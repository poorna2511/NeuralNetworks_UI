# NeuralNetworks_UI
GUI for training and testing neural networks model(under development)

Hello,

This project is concentrated to make a simple GUI for training and testing of neural networks model for given training data

**Input for the Application:**
Using can give training data in CSV file format by browse option
and adjust paramenters like number layers, learning rate, and number of neurons..etc.

**Testing Feature:**
In this application user can also load a trained model and testing data(in CSV file format)
and get results of all test cases in a table.

**Future Updates:**
1. option for selection of type of weight initilization technique
2. training type selection option
3. Improvement in training algorithm.
4. to configur more parameters related to training.

**Languages and Tech Used:**
1. C++, CLI
2. C# WinForms

**Working:**
Training and testing related code is entirly implemented in C++ using OOPS and STL which you can find in my other repo also.
From this C++ DLL are created and few functions are exported which will be used in C# winforms by CLI.
