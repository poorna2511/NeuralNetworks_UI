# NeuralNetworks_UI
GUI for training and testing neural networks model(under development)

Hello,

This project is concentrated to make a simple GUI for training and testing of neural networks model for given training data

**Tech Used:**
1. C++
2. C# WinForms

**Input for the Application:**
Using can give training data in CSV file format by browse option
and adjust paramenters like number layers, learning rate, and number of neurons..etc.

**Testing Feature:**
In this application user can also load a trained model and testing data(in CSV file format)
and get results of all test cases in a table.

**Future Updates:**
1. option for selection of type of weight initilization technique
2. training type selection option
3. Improvement in training algorithm.
4. to configur more parameters related to training.
